# TMED.05-Exercise-AddMediaNotification

In this exercise, you'll create MediaStyle notification that can act as an external client for controlling the Media Session, and therefore the media playback.
You'll then fix the MediaStyle notification actions by creating a MediaButtonReceiver that can respond to external client actions
